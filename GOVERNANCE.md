# Project Governance

There are three separate individual ranks that govern the Draft project. These are

1. Admiral of the Fleet
2. Admiral
3. Commodore

See [MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS.md) for the list of individuals that govern the Draft project.

## Admiral of the Fleet

Draft uses the timeless, highly efficient, and totally unfair system known as the "Benevolent
Dictator for Life". [Matthew Fisher][bacongobbler], the creator of Draft, is the Admiral of the
Fleet and has final say over all decisions related to Draft.

## Admiral

Admirals are engineers who either work or contribute to Draft on a frequent basis. They have
significant experience with the project and are considered "ship masters". The Admirals are
responsible for

- Technical direction
- Project governance and process (including this policy)
- Contribution policy
- Conduct guidelines
- Maintaining the list of individuals given the rank of Commmodore.

## Commodore

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are assigned the rank of Commodore upon
request. These individuals are identified by the Admirals and have moderate experience working with
the Draft project. Commodores have specific domain knowledge on a certain package or contribute
often to the project, but may have certain gaps of knowledge over the project or contribute on a
less frequent schedule to be promoted to Admiral.
