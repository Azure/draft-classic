# Project Governance

There are two separate individual ranks that govern the Draft project. These are

1. Admiral
2. Commodore

See [OWNERS](OWNERS) for the list of individuals that govern the Draft project.

## Admiral

Admirals are engineers who either work or contribute to Draft on a frequent basis. They have
significant experience with the project and are considered "ship masters". The Admirals are
responsible for

- Technical direction
- Project governance and process (including this policy)
- Contribution policy
- Conduct guidelines
- Maintaining the list of individuals given the rank of Commmodore.

## Commodore

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are assigned the rank of Commodore upon
request. These individuals are identified by the Admirals and have moderate or extensive experience
working with the Draft project. Commodores may have specific domain knowledge on a certain package or
contribute often to the project, but may also have certain gaps of knowledge over the project or
contribute on a less frequent schedule to be promoted to Admiral.

Commodores may also review PRs (and are encouraged to do so!), however they should consider if they
understand the domain. If they don't understand a particular piece of code or a specific design
decision, they should reach out and ask for clarification from the submitter or from an Admiral.
